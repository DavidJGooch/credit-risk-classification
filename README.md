# credit-risk-classification

# Overview of the Analysis
 The purpose of this activity was to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Doing so my creating two Machine learning models and using them to predict if a loan is health or a High risk. 

 # Results
-Model #1
 The model seems to predict healthy loans with 100% accuracy while it only seems to predict high risk loans at a 85% accuracy. Overall giving a average of 92.5% in predicting a health or high risk loan.  

-Model #2
 The model seems to predict healthy loans with 100% accuracy while it only seems to predict high risk loans at a 92% accuracy. Overall giving a average of 96% in predicting a health or high risk loan. 

 # Summary
The model was quite effective in predicting healthy loans giving a 100% precision on both models. It was less effective in predicting high risk loans giving a precision of 85% and 92% on each model respectively. In conclusion the model incorreclty predicts loans just 0.01% of the time. Thus I think would be effective if used in to predict loans.
